# Getting started

This guide will help you get started with MIKE+Py, from installation to running your first operations.

## Requirements

*   A licensed installation of MIKE+ (MIKE+Py is compatible with MIKE+ 2023 and later).
*   Python (x64) version 3.9 - 3.11.
*   (Windows) [VC++ redistributables](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) (often already installed if you have MIKE+).

::: {.callout-important title="Import Conflicts with `mikeio` and `mikeio1d`" collapse="true"}
Due to underlying library dependencies, `mikeplus` currently has known conflicts:

*   `mikeio` **cannot** be imported in the same Python process as `mikeplus`.
*   `mikeio1d` **must** be imported *after* `mikeplus`.

Please plan your scripts accordingly. For instance, if you need functionality from both `mikeio` and `mikeplus`, consider using separate Python processes or scripts. The environment variable `MIKEPLUSPY_DISABLE_CONFLICT_CHECKS=true` can be set to bypass these checks at your own risk.

## Installation

::: {.callout-tip}
# Using uv
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) is an extremely fast Python package and project manager that is 10-100x faster than pip, and also makes it easy to install Python and manage projects. With uv, creating a virtual environment is as easy as `uv venv`.
:::

To install MIKE+Py, run this command in your terminal:

::: {.panel-tabset}
## pip
```bash
pip install mikeplus
```

## uv
```bash
uv pip install mikeplus
```
:::

::: {.callout-note}
The Python package is named `mikeplus` (for `import mikeplus`) and is installed from PyPI using `pip install mikeplus`. The development repository is named `mikepluspy`.

## {{< fa fa-table >}} Accessing Model Data

The core of MIKE+Py is the `Database` object, which provides an interface to your MIKE+ model. You can open a model, access its tables, and query data.

Here's how to open a database and read a table into a pandas DataFrame:

```python
import mikeplus as mp

with mp.open("your_model_project.sqlite") as db:
    db.tables.msm_Node.select().to_pandas()
```

## {{< fa fa-play >}} Running a Simulation

MIKE+Py allows you to execute simulations defined in your MIKE+ model directly from Python.

This example runs the currently active simulation in the model:

```python
import mikeplus as mp

with mp.open("your_model_project.sqlite") as db:
    print(f"Running simulation: {db.active_simulation} for model type: {db.active_model}")
    
    # Run the active simulation
    result_files = db.run()
    
    print("Simulation finished. Result files:")
    for res_file in result_files:
        print(res_file)
```
