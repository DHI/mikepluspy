# User Guide

MIKE+Py is a Python package for interacting with MIKE+ model databases. It enables users to programmatically read, write, and manipulate model data, manage scenarios, execute simulations, and utilize various MIKE+ tools.

The core workflow typically involves:

*   Opening a MIKE+ [Database](database.qmd).
*   Accessing [Tables](tables.qmd) to [Query](queries.qmd) or modify data.
*   Running [Simulations](simulations.qmd).
*   Leveraging built-in [Tools](tools.qmd).

To get started, please see the [Getting Started](getting-started.qmd) page.
